I personally like minimal and clean solutions. I have been a big fan and long-term user of Laravel and Vuejs frameworks. I found them cleaner and neater than the alternatives. I also like the flexibility they give to the developer. When it comes to frontend, I had to hesitantly use Bootstrap. I found bootstrap a bit bloated and un-clean. (Probably just my personal preference) So when I found out about Tailwindcss, I was overjoyed. So I have been using Laravel, Vuejs and Tailwind for my recent and current projects. 

I have also noticed that I am dealing with more and more bigger projects which need good planning and longer maintenance requirement. I guess I am right at the stage after developing web applications for nearly a decade. Gone are the days when I can just develop a simple MVC Laravel only application for my clients. So I have to up my skills to deal those big projects. Meaning I have to study and practice Modular development, Repository design pattern, Presenter design pattern and such.

So I have tried to create a boilerplate project which meets my future needs. Result is "lavuta".

Still need to polish it a bit here and there but I am happy with it so far. I will be using it for my first personal project of 2020 ;)
