I personally like minimal and clean solutions. I have been a big fan and long-term user of Laravel, Vue.js, and Tailwind CSS frameworks.

## The Need for Something More

As I transitioned into larger-scale projects, I found myself requiring more advanced architectural patterns:
- Modular development
- Repository patterns
- Presenter patterns

## Introducing Lavuta

To support my evolving development needs, I created **lavuta** — a boilerplate project that combines my preferred stack with these architectural patterns.

I'm satisfied with the current state, though minor refinements remain. I plan to deploy it in my first personal 2020 project.
