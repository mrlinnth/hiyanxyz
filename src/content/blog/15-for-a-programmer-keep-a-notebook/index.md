After a decade in programming, I want to share insights about preserving information and reducing mental burden through systematic documentation.

## Three Key Benefits of Keeping a Notebook

### 1. Information Preservation

Programmers encounter daily data requiring retention:
- Project requirements
- Client requests
- Solutions found via Google and Stack Overflow

### 2. Mental Clarity

Rather than overloading memory with technical details, noting core concepts and resource locations frees cognitive capacity for problem-solving.

### 3. Work Documentation

Regular notes serve as daily records, helping programmers recall:
- Project decisions
- Function locations
- Implementation rationales months later

## Recommendations

When choosing a notebook app:
- Use a dedicated notebook app (not scattered notes)
- Look for essential features: categorization, tagging, multi-device access, backup capability, search functionality
- Establish a consistent filing system before beginning
- Record notes immediately during work

## My Personal Setup

I use:
- **Notion** for active projects
- **Joplin** for archiving older notes
- **Physical notebooks** for meetings
