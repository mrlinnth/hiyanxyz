As a child, I often dreamed about staying home instead of going to school. Now, as an adult, I've discovered that working from home comes with its own unexpected challenges.

Think about all those office frustrations we used to deal with:

- Missing morning commute deadlines
- Sitting through lengthy meetings
- Dealing with open-office dynamics
- Cubicle frustrations
- Crowded transit
- Workplace interruptions
- Mismatched office social circles

Now, with remote work becoming the reality many of us desired, the question is: does this arrangement prove satisfactory?

What has been your experience with this newfound work-from-home existence?
