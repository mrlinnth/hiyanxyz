Windows 10 is definitely becoming better in recent years. Can't deny that. I still found Linux Mint better for development and more beautiful.

## Performance Comparison

On modern hardware (SSD, 16GB RAM), there are minimal performance differences between Windows 10 and Linux Mint. However, Linux Mint excels on less powerful machines with superior smoothness and responsiveness.

## Why I Prefer Mint

I value Mint's user-friendly approach to Linux customization.

## My Development Setup

- **OS**: Linux Mint 20 Cinnamon with Arc-Dark theme and Zafiro icons
- **Terminal**: HyperTM terminal with zsh shell and Menlo font
- **IDE**: PhpStorm with Dracula theme and FiraCode font
- **Workflow**: Custom command launcher linked to bash scripts for project workflows
- **Desktop**: Clean aesthetic with minimal visible interface elements

## Future Posts

I plan to cover:
- Dual-booting setup
- Web development environments
- Configuration tips
